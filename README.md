# BarCoin Blockchain

A blockchain, called BarCoin, that allows for the storage of a timestamp and index, data and the hash of the previous block's hash.

The program creates "a public database where new data is stored in a container called a block and is added to an immutable chain (hence, blockchain) with data added in the past" (https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b)
